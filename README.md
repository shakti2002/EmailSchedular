# Email Scheduler Application

This project is an **Email Scheduler** that allows users to design and implement email marketing sequences through a visual flowchart interface. Users can log in or sign up to create, schedule, and send cold emails to recipients based on a customized flowchart. It is built using the MERN stack and leverages libraries like **React Flow**, **Agenda**, and **Nodemailer** to provide a seamless experience.
